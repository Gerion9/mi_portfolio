           I'm Gairo Peralta, a passionate Data Scientist with a diverse background spanning from Los Angeles, California to Villa de √Ålvarez, Colima, Mexico. My journey in data science began with a childhood fascination for mathematics and technology, which evolved into a professional pursuit at UC Berkeley.

         <p class="text-xl text-gray-300">
           My expertise lies in leveraging advanced analytics, machine learning, and AI to solve complex business problems. At STRTGY, I've led projects ranging from sociodemographic analysis using INEGI metrics to implementing AI-driven market analysis tools. My work often involves creating interactive visualizations and geospatial data analysis using tools like ARCGIS and GeoJSON.

         <p class="text-xl text-gray-300">
           Prior to my current role, I co-founded BlackPrint Technologies, where I served as the Lead Data Scientist, focusing on geospatial information systems and AI applications. My academic journey through the California community college system and UC Berkeley has equipped me with a unique perspective on data science and its practical applications.

         <p class="text-xl text-gray-300">
           Outside of work, I'm an avid learner, always exploring new technologies and methodologies in the field of data science. I balance my professional life with personal interests like watching series, going to the gym, and discovering local culinary gems.
